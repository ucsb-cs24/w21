## Relevant topics in the textbook:
Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++ Chapter 10

# Trees

* A collection of connected nodes
* One of the nodes is the "Root node"
* Each node can have many children nodes, but only a single parent node.

## Important terms:

* Root node
* Leaf node
* Subtree
* Parent node
* Key
* Level
* Degree

# Binary Trees

* Each node can have at most two children nodes


# Binary Search Trees

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
* No duplicate nodes
