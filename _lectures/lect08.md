# Trie

* Visualization tool can be found [here](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/Trie.html)

# Linked Lists

* There are many ways to organize data (data structures)
* We've seen examples of stacks and arrays
	* But there are others like trees, tries, hash tables, â€¦
* And there are many ways to IMPLEMENT these data structures
	* Some may use arrays (like arrayLists or vectors)
	* Some may use object pointers to link structures together.
		* Linked lists form a collection similar (but also very different) than an array.

* We can represent any type of data using structs.
* For example, an ITEM (Node) in a linked list can be a struct that contains some data (like a string, int, double, char, or another struct).
* The NEXT element in a linked list is a pointer to a linked list node representing the next item in the collection.
* Since we don't know how many elements a linkedList may contain, managing this structure on the heap is essential!

## Linked List Structs

* There are many ways we can implement a linked list, but we will focus on an singly-linked list implementation with a head and tail reference.
* A LinkedList struct will contain two pointers to linked list nodes:
	* one points to the first element of the list (head)
	* the other points to the last element of the list (tail).
* A node in a linked list will contain some data, and a pointer to the next Node in the linked list collection.

```
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node* next;
};

struct LinkedList {
  Node* head;
  Node* tail;
};
```

## Example of "walking down" a linked list

* Assume we have a linked list with the following nodes:

```
[10]->[20]->[30]->null
```

* We can walk down the collection and visit every node by using each Node's next pointer as long as the next pointer != NULL.

```
cout << list->head->data << endl; // 10
cout << list->head->next->data << endl; // 20
cout << list->head->next->next->data << endl; // 30
cout << list->head->next->next->next->data << endl; // seg fault!
```

* The performance of certain functionality with data structures largely depends on how the data is organized under-the-hood.
* On a high-level, arrays and linked lists are conceptually the same.
	* However, depending on what kind of operations performed on the data structure, performance may greatly differ. For example,
		* inserting to the front of a singly-linked linked list is much faster than inserting to the front of an array.
		* directly accessing an element in an array is much faster than directly accessing an element in a linked list.

## insertToFront() Linked List

* Order of pointer reassignment matters since we always want to make sure we don't "lose" the address of something we need on the heap.

1. Create new node to insert
2. Assign new node's next pointer to the current list's head.
3. Reassign the list's head to the new node.

## deleteIndex(int index)

Case 1: Remove first element

1. Reassign list head to list head's next pointer.
2. delete first element.

Case 2: Remove middle element

1. Reassign previous node's next pointer to current node's next pointer.
2. delete current node.

Case 3: Remove last element

1. Set previous node's next pointer to NULL.
2. Reassign list's tail pointer to previous node.
3. delete current node.
